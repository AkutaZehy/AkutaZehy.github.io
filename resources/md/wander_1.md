The sky is a fluid of bodies.

No, the sky we see is universe, so the universe is a fluid of bodies.

We buries the bodies deep under the surface, but then they appears in the sky.

Now we say, the underground is connected to the sky.

I have an idea, it is much like the way we digest food.

The body is digested by the ground.

So the stars are excretions. Digusting!

<br>

Don't forget, there ARE bright ones, so as the bleak ones.

Are the shining ones the excretion, or the dim ones?

From our knowledge of intuition, we think of gold, silver, and copper as the bright ones.

So we infer, the shining ones are the good ones.

But just take another think, there is contradiction.

Those metal solids never emitted light, their atoms were arranged in an orderly manner. On the contrary, it was the chaotic, high-speed moving objects that did.

It is the chaotic emission that caused the shining ones to be bright, not the kind, the order, or the arrangment of good virtue.
