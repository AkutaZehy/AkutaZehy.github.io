        <p>
          It's a work about the last tour of the girls,about the memories of myself and many selfs,about life,the real world and the thoughts,while displayed with the melody Point of no return'.</ br>
        </p>
        <h2>Part 1:Understanding of <em>Girls' Last Tour</em></h2>
        <h4>
          1.Reversed world:a little euphoria under 'the Anti-Utopia Value System'
        </h4>
        <p>*the Anti-Utopia is also henceforth referred to as AU.</p>
        <p class="intb">
          Frankly speaking,you have to watch <em>Girls' Last Tour</em>,<b>thoroughly</b>.<br />
          You see,many say that it's a quite depressive work and has an awfully heartbreaking ending.But that's only <b>Interpret out of context</b>.<br />
          The girls are living in an anti-utopia world,after a war almost/actually wiped out the human race.So it's normal,exactly speaking,is <b>environmental normal</b>.<br />

        <p>
          As mentioned,it's essential to base the understanding of the whole work on AU Value System,or misunderstanding occurs from time to time.
        </p>
  <p>What does the work want to convey?Take your minutes to carefully think about that.</p></ br>
  <p>When you are ready,roll your eyesight down to receive <em>a possible explanation</em>.</p>
  <p>Desperation?No.Not at most.On the contrary maybe <em>a little euphoria</em>.</p>
  <p>We should learn to have when we are growing up,just as Chito coul't abandon his diary,Yuuri couldn't lose her gun.But when they climbed up,they gradually abandoned everything.</p>
  <p>By the way,do you remember,when Kanazawa lost his maps,he cried out loudly,but when seperated,he smiled,staying opmistic and went on.When Ishii's aircraft crashed,she fell with a complex smile,consisting of hopelessness and frustration.We know their sad ending.<b>Every <em>nothing</em> fought for their fate.</p>
<p class="intb"><b>絶望と、仲良く。</b></p>
<p>That's words of Yuuri,also the spirit of the work.</p>
