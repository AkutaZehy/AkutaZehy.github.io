      <p>
        It's a work about the last tour of the girls,about the memories of myself and many selfs,about life,the real
        world and the thoughts,while displayed with the melody Point of no return'.</ br>

      <h2>Part 1:Understanding of <em>Girls' Last Tour</em></h2>
      <h4>
        1.Reversed world:a little euphoria under 'the Anti-Utopia Value System'
      </h4>
      <p>*the Anti-Utopia is also henceforth referred to as AU.</p>
      <p class="intb">
        Frankly speaking,you have to watch <em>Girls' Last Tour</em>,<b>thoroughly</b>.<br />
        You see,many say that it's a quite depressive work and has an awfully heartbreaking ending.But that's perhaps
        <b>interpret out of context</b> since quite a few haven't read the whole story.<br />
        The girls are living in an anti-utopia world,after a war almost/actually wiped out the human race.So it's
        normal,exactly speaking,is <b>environmental normal</b>.<br />
        ——Coolink_95
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned,it's essential to base the understanding of the whole work on AU Value System,or misunderstanding
        occurs from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>What does the work want to convey?Take your minutes to carefully think about that.</p><br />
      <p>When you are ready,roll your eyesight down to receive <em>a possible explanation</em>.<br />
        <p>Desperation?No.Not at most.On the contrary maybe <em>a little euphoria</em>.<br />
          By the way,do you remember,when Kanazawa lost his maps,he cried out loudly,but when seperated,he
          smiled,staying opmistic and went on.When Ishii's aircraft crashed,she fell with a complex smile,consisting of
          hopelessness and frustration.We know their sad ending.<b>Every <em>nothing</em> fought for their fate.</p>
        <p class="intb"><b>絶望と、仲良く。</b></p>
        <p>That's words of Yuuri,also the spirit of the work.</p>
        <p><b>In my opinion,the work reflects on our life,our growing up.</b><br />
          At the beginning Chito could't abandon his diary,Yuuri couldn't lose her gun.But when they climbed up,they
          gradually abandoned everything:when the Kettenkrad could no longer use,they took a nice bath,and went on by
          walking;Yuuri <i>threw</i> her gun away to make the journey easier;Chito burned her diary for warmth.And
          finally they reached the end,and finally had <i>a long sleep</i>.<br />
          So do us.We should learn to have somthing when we're young,but when we grow up,we gradually realize what is
          important while what is not.Having seperated from what we love,so that we can forth with less burden.<br />
          Also,the older we are,the less needs do we have.According to <i>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</i>,our needs are
          dived into 5 levels:Physiological needs,Safety needs,Love and belonging,Esteem and
          Self-actualization(Self-Transcendence needs).Roughly speaking,this work in AU actually shows a retrogression
          of needs.The girls cared more about their physiological needs than spiritual ones as the story advance.Somehow
          that's because they <i>do</i> had more physiological needs,but in other aspects,it shows a unique
          understanding of life:</p>
        <p class="intb"><b>When satisfied with everything,so we can face death without hesitation and regret</b>.<br />
        </p>
        <p>As for Kanazawa and Ishii,maybe they just serve as a foil to main figures,showing other attitudes towards
          life.</p>
        <p>In this work,we see many desperate moments,and we also should get along with those.To face the rough life
          with a flattened attitude,to enjoy the pure way of what ancient people do may be one explaionation of this
          work.</p><br />
