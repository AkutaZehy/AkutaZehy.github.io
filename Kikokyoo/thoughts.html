        <p>
          It's a work about the last tour of the girls,about the memories of myself and many selfs,about life,the real world and the thoughts,while displayed with the melody Point of no return'.</ br>

        <h2>Part 1:Understanding of <em>Girls' Last Tour</em></h2>
        <h4>
          1.Reversed world:a little euphoria under 'the Anti-Utopia Value System'
        </h4>
        <p>*the Anti-Utopia is also henceforth referred to as AU.</p>
        <p class="intb">
          Frankly speaking,you have to watch <em>Girls' Last Tour</em>,<b>thoroughly</b>.<br />
          You see,many say that it's a quite depressive work and has a awfully heartbreaking ending.But that's only <b>Interpret out of context</b>.<br />
          The girls are living in an anti-utopia world,after a war almost/actually wiped out the human race.So it's normal,exactly speaking,is <b>environmental normal</b>.<br />

        <p>
          As mentioned,it's essential to base the understanding of the whole work on AU Value Stsytm,or misunderstanding occurs from time to time.
