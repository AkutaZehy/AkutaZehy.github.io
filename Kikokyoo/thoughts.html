        1.Reversed world,a little euphoria in the Post-Apocalyptic World<br />
      </h4>
      
      <p><em>*Post-Apocalyptic is also henceforth referred to as P-A.</em></p>
      <p class="intb">
        Frankly speaking,you have to watch <em>Girls' Last Tour</em>,<b>thoroughly</b>.<br />
        You see,many say that it's a quite depressive work and has an awfully heartbreaking ending.But that's perhaps
        <b>interpret out of context</b> since quite a few haven't read the whole story.<br />
        The girls are living in a post-apocalyptic world,after a war almost/actually wiped out the human race.So it's
        normal,exactly speaking,is <b>environmental normal</b>.<br />
        ——Coolink_95
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned,it's essential to base the understanding of the whole work in a P-A world,or misunderstanding
        occurs from time to time.<br />
        What does the work want to convey?Take your minutes to carefully think about that.<br />
        When you are ready,roll your eyesight down to receive <em>a possible explanation</em>.</p>
        
      <h6>i.</h6>
      <p>Let's describe the work first.<br />
        Desperation?No from one aspect.On the contrary maybe <em>a little euphoria</em>.<br />
        By the way,do you remember,when Kanazawa lost his maps,he cried out bluely,but when seperated,he
        smiled,staying opmistic and went on.When Ishii's aircraft crashed,she fell with a complex smile,consisting of
        hopelessness and frustration.We know their sad ending.<b>Every <em>nothing</em> fought for their fate.</b></p>
      <p class="intb"><b>絶望と、仲良く。</b></p>
      <p>That's words of Yuuri,also the spirit of the work.<br /></p>
      
      <h6>ii.</h6>
      <p>In my opinion,the work reflects on our life,our growing up.<br />
        At the beginning Chito could't abandon his diary,Yuuri couldn't lose her gun.But when they climbed up,they
        gradually abandoned everything:when the Kettenkrad could no longer use,they took a nice bath,and went on by
        walking;Yuuri <i>threw</i> her gun away to make the journey easier;Chito burned her diary for warmth.And
        finally they reached the end,and finally had <i>a long sleep</i>.<br />
        So do us.We should learn to have somthing when we're young,but when we grow up,we gradually realize what is
        important while what is not.Having seperated from what we love,so that we can forth with less burden.<br />
        Also,the older we are,the less needs do we have.According to <i>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</i>,our needs are
        dived into 5 levels:Physiological needs,Safety needs,Love and belonging,Esteem and
        Self-actualization(Self-Transcendence needs).Roughly speaking,this work in P-A world actually shows a retrogression
        of needs.The girls cared more about their physiological needs than spiritual ones as the story advance.Somehow
        that's because they <i>do</i> had more physiological needs,but in other aspects,it shows a unique
        understanding of life:</p>
      <p class="intb"><b>When satisfied with everything,so we can face death without hesitation and regret</b>.<br />
      </p>
      
      <h6>iii.</h6>
      <p>As for Kanazawa and Ishii,maybe they just serve as a foil to main figures,showing other attitudes towards
        life.<br />
        In this work,we see many desperate moments,and we also should get along with those.To face the rough life
        with a flattened attitude,to enjoy the pure way of what ancient people do may be one explaionation of this
        work.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking,I would conclude this opinion like this:</p>
      <p class="intb">When <em>Bible</em> told us,<br />
        For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have more: but from him who has not, even what he has will be
        taken away.<br />
        I would like to say,<br />
        <b>Be appreciated for what you have more,be peaceful for what you don't.<br />Get along well with
          desperation.</b></p><br />


      <h4>
        2.Mirror of real life,what ARE we doing?
      </h4>
      <p>Reflect on the work again for a few minutes,thinking about the relationship among ALL figures.<br />When you
        are ready,roll your eyes down to see what happens next.</p>
      <p>Let's go.<br /></p>
      
      <h6>i.</h6>
      <p>The story happened as a post war scene,so most of the unreal scenes can be easily explained,such as: </p>
      <p class="intb">[Food]Divided in half,so a month;for myself,a week.<br /></p>
      <p>But have you ever thought that all of these <em>have happened,are happening,and will be happening</em>?<br />
        For example,when the deadly Plague(also Black Death) attacked Europe,we've lost millions of people.<b>People
          have been facing disaster from time to time.</b><br />
        For example,when we are arguing with our best friends,that's <em>the smallest war</em>,as Chito and Yuuri
        often did.<br />
        For example,When insanes gather,then maybe the humans' fortune could end.That probably be <em>the
          Future</em>,as it is joking said,
      </p>
      <p class="intb">Never doubt that any person could exist since there's many.</p>
      <p><em>And <b>numberous</b> examples.</em>It's sad to know this fact.</p>
      
      <h6>ii.</h6>
      <p>But why not be delighted?Good things are happening in the meantime.</p>
      <p class="intb">Lock was only designed for <em>Normals</em>.Saints never thought about stealing,while Evils
        never forgot.</p>
      <p>Perhaps,I need to refer to another interviewee.</p>
      <p class="intb">... But what Girls' Last Tour strongly transmits is the teamwork,because everyone has different
        skills which are needed in order to survive.<br />
        ——Modem／くるみん　さん</p>
      <p>As mentioned,every nothing fought for their fate.<em><b>So do nothings</b></em>.<br />
        And that's we are doing,<br />
        <b>On your post</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Generally speaking,I would conclude this opinion like this:</p>
      <p class="intb"><b>Watching them,<em>watching</em> yourself.</b></p><br />

      <h4>
        3.Lifelong tourist,life destination and moral questions
      </h4>
      <p>Take a look at yourself.<br />
        Gradually you find yourself in a really embarrassing condition.<br />
        For different person,the period lasts for different length.</p>
      <p>When Human fought for living,the manager stayed slient and left the right to decide the fish's life to Human,while the AI in CONNECTION_TOWER_6(maybe called so) prayed and for death. <br />
        SARCASTIC.<br />
        It reminds me of <em>KAPPA(河童)</em> and its author,Akutagawa Ryunosuke(芥川龍之介)<br />
        Read him,and his encounter is what I want to tell you.</p><br />
        
      <h5><b>Morever</b>.
      </h5>
      <p>Well,I have to say,this used to be the part I've forgotten for such a long time and caused me had a really narrow understanding of this work.<br />
      A little challenging this part,be patient and read the content below.<br />
      It's about <b>humanity,nature and cycle</b>.<br /><br />
      To be honest,I have't read many books about philosophy such as <em>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</em>(by Arthur Schopenhauer,1819),so my point of view is actually one-sided.However,the process of sharing is quite enjoyful.<br />
      Let's start with a simple question:<br />
      How will you define <em>HUMAN</em> or <em>HUMANITY</em>,in order to set them apart from other creatures?

    <h2>Part 2:Experience about the work,帰郷(きこ きょう)</h2>
    <div>
      <h4>1.Storyboard</h4>
      <p>To write the storyboard well,I read the manga and scanned anime for enough times.<br />
        The core is to contain and mix everything together in one video.<br />
        Of course,to come up with an idea is awesome,but find a method to express it is quite demanding.<br />
      </p>
      <h4>2.Audio</h4>
      <p>To be honest it's really a miserable and also joyful process.</p>
      <h6>i.first Part,the base audio</h6>
      <p>This part finished quite early,20/02/XX or so.<br />
        Since there are good deeds and original song,earcopying is no more difficult.</p>
